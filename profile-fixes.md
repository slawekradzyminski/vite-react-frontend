# Order Details Page Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create an order details page that displays when a user clicks on an order in their order history. This page will show comprehensive information about a specific order, including items purchased, pricing details, shipping information, and order status.

## Features

### 1. Order Summary Section
- Order ID and date
- Order status with visual indicator (pending, processing, shipped, delivered)
- Total amount paid
- Payment method used
- Shipping method and estimated delivery date

### 2. Items Section
- List of all items in the order
- Each item should display:
  - Product image
  - Product name
  - Quantity
  - Price per unit
  - Total price for the item
- Option to reorder individual items or the entire order

### 3. Shipping Information
- Delivery address
- Tracking number (if available)
- Shipping carrier information
- Estimated/actual delivery date

### 4. Order Actions
- Cancel order button (if order status allows)
- Return/exchange options (for delivered items)
- Contact support regarding this order
- Print invoice/receipt

## Implementation Steps

### 1. API Integration
- Create new API endpoint in `src/api/orders.ts` to fetch detailed order information
- Add TypeScript types for order details in `src/types/order.ts`
- Implement React Query hooks for data fetching and caching

### 2. Routing
- Add new route in `src/App.tsx` for order details: `/profile/orders/:orderId`
- Implement navigation from order history to order details

### 3. UI Components
- Create `OrderDetailsPage` component in `src/pages/order-details/index.tsx`
- Implement sub-components:
  - `OrderSummary`
  - `OrderItems`
  - `ShippingDetails`
  - `OrderActions`
- Add loading and error states

### 4. Testing
- Write unit tests for all components
- Create E2E tests for the order details flow
- Test edge cases (canceled orders, partial shipments, etc.)

## UI/UX Considerations
- Use a breadcrumb navigation to allow easy return to profile/orders
- Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop views
- Use color coding for different order statuses
- Add animations for status changes
- Ensure accessibility compliance

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time order status updates
- Integration with shipping carrier APIs for live tracking
- Order history filtering and search
- Customer feedback/rating system for delivered orders
